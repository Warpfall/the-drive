A blender animation and teamwork exercise.

This project will focus on:
Organizing blend files for teamwork.
Learning to use github.


/blend
This directory contains a 'main.blend' file. Other files are linked into this file. If you want to see the animation in blender, use this file.

'child_' blend files are linked into the 'main.blend' file. If you want to add your own object to the animation, I suggest you fork this project, add the file in your own fork, and make a pull request.

How to get started:
Doing this requres a little knowledge of github.
